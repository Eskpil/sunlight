# Sunlight

Modern directory service guaranteeing encryption, multiple layers of security and domain segmentation.

Sunlight says good night to your traditional LDAP and ADFS by using new techniques such as tpm2 and openid to verify
both the users identity but also the machine identity. Sunlight could be combined with an SDN (Software Defined Network)
where we could achieve network segmentation in our domains.

Take a look at the [architecture](./docs/architecture.md) to understand more.
